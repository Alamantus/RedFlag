The content warning site.
 
 ## Idea
 
 Create a simple interface to place an optional wall between the user and the content at the other end of a link with a
 variety of different warnings to alert the user about. Also acts as a mask for social media by rendering a warning image
 instead of the content at the target site, if that content is sensitive or disturbing.
